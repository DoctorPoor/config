# Quick setup for MacOS

Here's a quick setup of some of my preferences on a mac machine.

To apply them, simply:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DoctorPoor/config.git`
1. Change directory into the repo: `cd /config`
1. Update line 5 in `.zshrc` with `export ZSH=/Users/<insert_your_user_here>/.oh-my-zsh` (i.e your own /Users path)
1. Run the setup script: `sh fresh_machine.sh`
